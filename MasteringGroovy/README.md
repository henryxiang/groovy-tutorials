# MasteringGroovy
Several projects covered in MasteringGroovy video course from O'Reilly

The root project has src/main/groovy and src/test/groovy for the functional aspects of the course and several demos.

For each subproject (GroovyMortgage, GroovyAspect, AccountManagement, HibernateJPA, VampireMovies,
people, and people_readwrite), import it separately into IntelliJ IDEA by selecting the build.gradle file for that project 
during the import process.

Alternatively, generate an IntelliJ project using "./gradlew cleanIdea idea" and then import that project.
Eclipse projects can be generated using "./gradlew cleanEclipse eclipse"

The projects are unrelated, other than all being discussed in the video course.

URL for the video course is: http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920041856.do

The Spock projects are not included in this repo. See the "spock-workshop" project directly under my account. The "solutions" branch
has everything covered in the video and more.

Good luck,

Ken Kousen
